# Weather Forecasting Using SARIMA and LSTM Models

This project aims to forecast daily temperature using a hybrid SARIMAâ€“LSTM model.  
The SARIMA model captures the linear temporal patterns, while the LSTM model learns nonlinear dependencies in the BMKG temperature dataset.  
This approach combines traditional statistical and deep learning methods for more accurate weather prediction.

## Dataset
The dataset i use contains daily temperature data obtained from BMKG (Indonesia Meteorology Agency).  
Data covers multiple months of temperature readings used for training and testing.
